## v2 Requirements (Deferred)

- Real job photos replacing Unsplash placeholders in Gallery — needs photo shoot
- Suburb landing pages (Sunnybank, Eight Mile Plains, etc.) — expand local SEO footprint
- Image lazy loading + width/height attributes — Core Web Vitals improvement
- BreadcrumbList schema on variation pages — richer Google results

## Out of Scope

- Blog / editorial content — long-tail pages cover the SEO surface area; blog adds maintenance overhead
- User accounts / booking system — quote form volume is sufficient; booking system premature
- eCommerce / online payments — jobs require in-person assessment before pricing
- Dark mode — brand is defined; toggle not needed
- Backend infrastructure / CMS — static site approach is correct for current scale
